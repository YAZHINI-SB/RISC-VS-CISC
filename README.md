# RISC-VS-CISC
Information about RISC and CISC
                                                             RISC AND CISC 
RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture)
•	RISC is to simplify the hardware by using instruction set consisting of operations like load, store etc. and also consumes less power. In RISC each instruction in a single word.
•	RISC Architecture used in mobile phones.
 
CHARACTERISTICS OF RISC:
•	Simple instruction, so simple is the instruction decoding.
•	Instruction can fit into single word.
•	Instruction gets executed in a single clock cycle.
•	Less   complex .
ADVANTAGES:
•	Faster execution.
•	Simpler instruction
•	Less power consumption
    DISADVANTAGES:
•	More number of lines of codes.
•	High cost.
•	As the number of instructions increases, the memory space required to execute the instruction also increases.
CISC (Complex Instruction Set Architecture)
•	CISC consists of small lines of code and each line of code performing multiple tasks.
•	CISC Architecture is used computer, IOT devices.
	CISC-Software- simple, hardware –complex.
	RISC-Software-complex, hardware-simple.
 
  CHARACTERISTICS OF CISC:
•	Complex instruction.
•	Instruction  are larger than word size.
•	Instruction is not executed in a single clock cycle.
•	Complex instruction set.

   ADVANTAGE:
•	Reduced code size as multiple instruction are executed at same time .
•	As the lines of code , executes multiple instruction it memory space is less.
•	Most preffered.
   DISADVANTAGE:
•	Slower execution.
•	More complex design.
•	Higher power consumption.
In a survey it is found that  , only 20% of instruction is used in Cisc. 

NO	            RISC	                                          CISC
1	          Simpler instruction takes one cycle.	            Complex instruction taking multiple cycles
2	          Very few instruction refer memory.	               Most of instruction may refer memory.
3	          Few instruction                                    Many instruction
4	          Highly pipelined	                                 Not pipelined
5	          Multiple register sets	                           Single register set
6	          Fixed format instructions	                         Variable format instructions
